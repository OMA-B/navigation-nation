# navigation-nation

This is a simple project to build my knowledge on how to make a custom menu bar and animated navigation...

Resources used:

--fonts from Google Fonts

--color combination from https://paletton.com/

I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through and understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
